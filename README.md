### Android App set-up:
* The application has to be authorised to access the Firebase Database to retrieve values from it. To do so you have to add the SHA1 key of the android app into Firebase.
  * To check the SHA1 key of your android app, use this link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15727912/sha-1-fingerprint-of-keystore-certificate
  * Add the SHA1 key into your Firebase through Project Settings > Your apps > Add App.
